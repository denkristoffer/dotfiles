# dotfiles

Dotfiles to set up a macOS installation to my liking.

Based on/stolen from:

- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

## Installation

- Sign in to the App Store manually
- Run `git` command to prompt for installing developer tools
- ``FRESH_LOCAL_SOURCE=denkristoffer/dotfiles /bin/bash -c "`curl -sL https://get.freshshell.com`"``

Still requires some manual setup after running, but this is a good base.
