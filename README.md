# dotfiles

Dotfiles to set up a macOS installation to my liking.

Based on/stolen from:

- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

## Installation

- Sign in to the App Store manually
- Run `git` command to prompt for installing developer tools
- Symlink fresh config file `ln -s "$HOME/.dotfiles/freshrc" "$HOME/.freshrc"`
- ``FRESH_LOCAL_SOURCE=denkristoffer/dotfiles /bin/bash -c "`curl -sL https://get.freshshell.com`"``

The system still requires some manual setup after running, remember to open and run the Little Snitch installer with e.g. `open /usr/local/Caskroom/little-snitch/4.5/LittleSnitch-4.5.dmg` â€“ the path changes with the version.
